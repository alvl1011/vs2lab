I was so excited to finally see the ocean! The ocean was massive, stretching out as
far as the eye could see. I stood on the beach and gazed out at the waves, mesmerized by
their constant movement. The water was a deep blue-green color, with hints of turquoise in
the sunlight. As I watched, the waves crashed against the shore with a powerful force, leaving
a frothy white foam in their wake. The ocean was truly a sight to behold - I couldn't take my eyes off it!
